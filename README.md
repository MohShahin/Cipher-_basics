<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>The meaning of encryption, decryption, and its history:</h2>
When we encrypt a text, we turn it from an understandable text with meaning (plaintext/original) into a meaningless set of letters and signs (cipher text).
On the other hand, decrypting is turning a set of letters and signs back from being meaningless (ciphered) into a meaningful message that the user can understand (deciphered), which is the complete copy of the original text.
General History
<h3>First appearance</h3>
To begin, the first evidence of the use of cryptography was discovered in an inscription carved around 1900 BC in the chamber of a nobleman's tomb in Egypt.The scribe used some unfamiliar hieroglyphic symbols in place of more ordinary ones. The purpose was not to hide the message, but to change its shape and meaning, making the script not understandable unless it returned to its true form. Even though the inscription was different, it was still based on the original text in some way.
Evidence of some use of encryption and decryption (cryptography) appeared in most major ancient civilizations. For example, Kautilya's "Arthshashtra," a classic work on government, talks about India's spy service and how assignments were given to spies in "secret writing."
<h3>In the world war,</h3>
During the first two years of World War I, code systems were used for high-command and diplomatic communications, just as they had been for centuries, and cipher systems were used almost exclusively for tactical communications. However, field cipher systems, such as the U.S. Signal Corps’s cipher disk mentioned above, lacked sophistication (and security), however. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, some complicated cipher systems were used for high-level communications, the most famous of which was the German ADFGVX fractionation cipher, described in the section "Cryptography: Product ciphers" (Simmons, 2016).
Modern use
<h3>In modern days,</h3> cryptography is widely used in banks and messaging apps such as WhatsApp, where text and messages are all end-to-end encrypted.
